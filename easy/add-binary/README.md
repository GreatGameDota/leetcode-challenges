Details: The problem is simply adding two binary numbers and returning their sum as a binary number. My algorithm manually does addition where it starts all the way to the right and adds each digit while keeping track of a remainder. I then clean up the addition if the lengths of the binary numbers are different. This algorithm is far from most efficient and has a runtime of O(n) where n is the length of the longest binary number input.
