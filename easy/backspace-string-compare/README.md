Details: The problem is seeing if two strings are the same after evaluating both strings where '#' is like backspacing the last character. My algorithm builds both strings by iterating over both and removing characters before any '#'. This runs in O(n+m) runtime and O(n+m) space complexity which isn't the most optimal algorithm which uses O(1) space.
