Details: The problem is determining the final score of a game where each step is given as a string in a list. If its a number, just add to the total score, if it is a C then remove number from score, if it is a D double the last added score and add to total and if it's a + sum the previous two scores and add to total. My algorithm uses a vector like a stack and uses two variables to keep track of the previous and previous of the previous numbers. This runs in O(n) runtime and O(n) space complexity which is the most optimal for this problem.
