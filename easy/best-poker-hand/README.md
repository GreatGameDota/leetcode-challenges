Details: The problem is determining the best poker hand given two arrays representing the suits and ranks of all cards in your hand. My algorithm counts the frequency of the suits and ranks to determine the most frequent cards and whether the hand is a flush, three of a find, pair, or none of the above. This runs in O(n+m) runtime with O(n+m) space which is not the most optimal algorithm (this can be done in O(1) space).
