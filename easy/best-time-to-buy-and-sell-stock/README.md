Details: The problem is simply calculating the most possible profit from buying a stock and then selling it sometime in the future. My algorithm simply finds the cheapest time to buy the stock at the same time as calculating the profit using the previous smallest price. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
