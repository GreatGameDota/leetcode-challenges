Details: The problem is simply calculating amount of taxes due on a given income given a bracket of amount taxed and tax percentage. My algorithm simply loops over each bracket and calculates the amount being taxed and the percentage value of the tax. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
