Details: The problem is determining whether a list meets the requirements where the ith number in the list has to appear list\[i\] amount of times in the whole list. My algorithm loops over the list counting the amount of times each number appears then loops again checking that the correct amount of numbers appeared. This runs in O(n) runtime and O(n) space which is the most optimal.
