Details: The problem is simply calculating the amount of ways you can climb n steps where you can either take 1 or 2 steps at a time. My algorithm does top-down dp using recursion and memoization to explore all possible ways and return the total ways that lead to the end. This is optimal but not the most optimal in terms of space complexity.
