Details: The problem is simply counting all asterisks in a string that appear between pairs of pipe characters. My algorithm loops over the string, keeps track of whether it has passed the beginning of a pair of pipes and counts the amount of asterisks inside the pair of pipes. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
