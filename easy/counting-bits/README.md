Details: The problem is simply counting the amount of 1 bits that appear in all numbers between 0 to n. My algorithm loops 0 to n and for each number uses the c++ built in function popcount to get the amount of 1 bits. This is an optimal solution but is not the most optimal which uses dp and bit manipulation.
