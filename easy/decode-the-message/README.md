Details: The problem is decoding a given string using a key string where the first appearances of every letter in the key is where it appears in the normal alphabet. My algorithm first strips the key string to remove spaces and repeated characters to get a new alphabet. Then it loops over the message and finds where each letter occurs in the key alphabet and adds the letter at that index of the original alphabet to the decoded message.
