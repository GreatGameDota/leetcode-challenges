Details: The problem is determining whether a player is guaranteed to win the game given a starting number. The game is where each player picks a factor of the current number and subtracts the current number by that value and whoever is left with just 1 loses. The solution is simply just to check if the starting number is even or odd because if the starting number is even then the second player will always have an odd number if 1 is picked as the factor. This is the most optimal solution.
