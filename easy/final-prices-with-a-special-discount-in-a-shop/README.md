Details: The problem is calculating the discounted prices for all items in a store where the discount price is the next number in the list that is less than or equal to the current item. My algorithm uses a monotonic stack in order to find the next number that is less than any previous numbers in the list. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
