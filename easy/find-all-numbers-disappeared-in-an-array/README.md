Details: The problem is simply finding the missing numbers in an array where the correct numbers are numbers between 1 to size of the array. My algorithm is the same as the "Missing Number" problem. The algorithm runs in O(2n) runtime with O(1) space complexity (not counting return array) which is the most optimal.
