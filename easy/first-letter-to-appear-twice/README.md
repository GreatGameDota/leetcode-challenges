Details: The problem is simply finding the first occurrence of a letter which appears twice in a string. My algorithm uses an array of size 26 to count the frequencies of all letters in the string and return the first letter that appears twice. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
