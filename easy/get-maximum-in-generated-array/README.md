# Get Maximum in Generated Array

## Easy

Details: The problem is simply finding the largest value in a generated array based on a given n length. My algorithm uses dp to build the array and at the same time keep track of the largest value generated. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal algorithm however my solution can be greatly cleaned up.
