Details: The problem is simply implementing a stack with queues. My algorithm uses a single stack and whenever a pop or top operation occurs it loops through the queue moving everything from the front to the back making it like a queue. My algorithm is not the most efficient algorithm but only uses 1 queue instead of 2.
