Details: The problem is simply finding the intersection of two arrays and including duplicate repeated numbers. My algorithm sorts the two lists then uses two pointers to go through all the numbers in each list and checking if they are the same. This algorithm runs in O(nlogn+mlogm+n+m) runtime with O(1) space complexity which is the most optimal algorithm in terms of space (runtime can be better using maps/sets).
