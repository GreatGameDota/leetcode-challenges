Details: The problem is simply determining if a string is a subsequence of another string. My algorithm uses two pointers to iterate over the larger string and search for each letter in the smaller string. This runs in O(n) runtime, where n is the length of the bigger string, and O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
