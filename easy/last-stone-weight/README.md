Details: The problem is finding the two biggest numbers in the list and adding the positive difference of them back to the list (removing the two nodes unless the difference is 0). My algorithm uses a max heap to keep all the numbers ordered and it then just pops the first two numbers off the list until there is only 1 number left. This is the most efficient algorithm.
