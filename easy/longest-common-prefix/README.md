Details: The problem is simply finding the longest prefix in a list of strings. My algorithm is a horrible brute force method that loops through all strings comparing the beginnings of each string and only returning if the beginning of a string doesn't match or it reached the end of a string. The runtime for this algorithm is too complicated to calculate.
