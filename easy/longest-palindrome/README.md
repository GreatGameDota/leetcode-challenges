Details: The problem is simply determining the longest palindrome that can be constructed from a given list of characters. My algorithm first counts the frequency of each type of character, then counts all the even pairs that can be made using each character before adding an extra 1 if there is an odd character. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
