Details: The problem is simply finding the amount of times you can spell balloon given a collection of characters. My algorithm simply counts the amount of b's, a's, l's, o's, and n's in the given string then returns the amount of times balloon can be spelled. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime which is the fastest possible runtime.
