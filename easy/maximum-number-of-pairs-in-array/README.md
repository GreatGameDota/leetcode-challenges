Details: The problem is simply determining the amount of pairs of same numbers in a list and returning the amount of these pairs and the amount of left over numbers not in pairs. My algorithm counts the occurrences of every number in the list then loops over the occurrences and divides each by two and mods each by two. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
