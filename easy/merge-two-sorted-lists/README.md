Details: The problem is simply merging two sorted linked lists into one whole sorted list. My algorithm first steps through both, incrementing through each based on which is added to the new list. After it reaches the end of one of the lists it then loops through the remaining lists' elements. This algorithm runs in O(n+m) runtime.
