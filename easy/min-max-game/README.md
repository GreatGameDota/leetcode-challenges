Details: The problem is taking pairs of numbers out of an array and creating a new array with the min or max of each pair of numbers until there is only one number left. My algorithm recursively builds new lists by looping over each pair and finding the min and max based on if its an even or odd pair. This is the most optimal algorithm.
