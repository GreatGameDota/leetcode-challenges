Details: The problem is calculating the smallest amount of cost to move all chips lined up in an array to the same position where you can move each chip 1 or 2 spots left or right with 0 and 1 cost respectively. The solution simply boils down to whichever amount of odd and even chips is the smallest as you have to move all even or odd chips once with a cost of 1. This is the most optimal solution.
