Details: The problem is simply finding the smallest sum of two numbers made up from digits of a given 4 digit number. My algorithm first extracts the 4 digits from the given number and sorts them. Then it just builds two 2-digit numbers where the first digit of each number are the 2 smallest given digits. This is the most optimal algorithm.
