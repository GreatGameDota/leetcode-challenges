Details: The problem is simply moving all zeros to the end of a list in-place. My algorithm loops through the list until it finds a zero then continues while swapping the zero down the list. If it encounters more zeros then the length of each swap is expanded until the algorithm reaches the end of the list. This is an optimal algorithm but not the most optimal and can be cleaned up.
