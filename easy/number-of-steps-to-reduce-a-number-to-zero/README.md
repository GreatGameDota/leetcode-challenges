Details: The problem is simply figuring out the amount of steps to reduce a number down to zero where each step is either dividing an even number by 2 or subtracting 1 from an odd number. My solution simply loops until the number is zero and dividing if even or subtracting if odd. This runs in O(logn) runtime which is not the most optimal runtime of O(1) using bit manipulation.
