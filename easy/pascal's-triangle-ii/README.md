Memory Usage: 6.4 mb

Details: The problem is simply computing the Pascal's Triangle but only returning the given row number. My algorithm loops the needed rows and for each row steps through it computing the sum using two previous values held in variables from the return list and setting the value in the same list. This algorithm has the most optimal runtime and space complexity.
