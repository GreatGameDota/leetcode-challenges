Details: The problem is simply computing the Pascal's Triangle for the given amount of rows. My algorithm loops the needed rows and for each row steps through it computing the sum using the previous row and adding the value. This algorithm has the most optimal runtime.

6/9/22: I added a second solution which is a proper dp solution that is the most optimal algorithm.
