Details: The problem is simply finding a path from the root to leaf which the sum is equal to a given target. My algorithm uses recursive dfs and keeps track of the sum at each node it visits. Then when it reaches a leaf it checks the sum if its equal to target. This runs in O(n) runtime which is the most optimal.
