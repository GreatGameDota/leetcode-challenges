Details: The problem is simply adding 1 to a list of digits. My algorithm just adds a one if the last digits isn't 9 else it searches from the back clearing any 9s and adding 1 if it doesn't find a 9. If the search reaches the end then it makes the first digit 1 and adds a 0 to the end. This is the most optimal algorithm.
