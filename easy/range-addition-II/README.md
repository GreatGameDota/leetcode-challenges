Details: The problem is simply finding the amount of instances the biggest number appears in a range after a given amount of operations is performed on it. All operations start from the origin (0,0) so the optimal algorithm I used is to just find the smallest row and column operations which at the end correspond to the area of the greatest number. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime where n is the amount of operations, this runtime is the best possible.
