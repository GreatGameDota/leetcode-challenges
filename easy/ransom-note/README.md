Details: The problem is simply determining if a given string can be constructed using letters from another given string. My algorithm uses a hashmap to count all letters in the larger second string and then loops over the target string counting the amount of found letters until a letter isn't found or until the string is finished. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
