Details: The problem is simply removing all duplicate numbers from a sorted linked list of numbers. My solution is a simple iterative algorithm that checks every node in the list if they repeat. I loop through the list looking at the next node of the current node I'm at. If I find they repeat I move to the node after and repeat until I get to a new value. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime which is the best runtime.
