Details: The problem is simply calculating how many palindromic subsequences appear in a string of a's and b's. The solution just involves checking if the original string is a palindrome because then there is only one palindromic subsequence. And if the original string isn't a palindrome then there are just two subsequences of just a's and just b's. This is the most optimal algorithm.
