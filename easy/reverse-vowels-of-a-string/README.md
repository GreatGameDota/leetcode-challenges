Details: The problem is simply reversing all vowels in a string. My solution first loops through the string and collects all vowels and thens loops again and for each appearance of a vowel places the reverse order of the collected vowels. This runs in O(2n) runtime and O(n) space complexity which isn't the most optimal solution of O(n), O(1) using two pointers.
