Details: The problem is simply converting a roman numeral string to integer number. My algorithm just loops through the string checking if the next number is bigger than the current one. If it is bigger then I increment a counter by the bigger minus the smaller and if it is not bigger I just add the current value. This algorithm runs in O(n) which is the best runtime for this problem.
