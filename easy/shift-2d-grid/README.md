Details: The problem is simply shifting a 2d grid k amount of times. Where shifting is just moving each element in each row over 1 spot and moving overlaps to the next row. My algorithm first divides k so no work is being repeated. Then it swaps entire rows until k is less than the length of a row so then it just loop the rest and shuffle all the values in the list. This is pretty efficient but is not the most efficient algorithm.
