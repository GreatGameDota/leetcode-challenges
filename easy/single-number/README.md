Details: The problem is simply detecting the number in a list that does not repeat. My algorithm first sorts the list then loops through it checking every pair of numbers that they are the same. If it finds a pair that aren't the same it returns that number. This algorithm runs in O(nlogn) runtime. The best possible runtime is O(n) using XOR.
