Details: The problem is simply sorting an array of numbers so that evens appear before odds. My algorithm first counts the amount of evens in the list then loops that amount swapping any odd numbers to count position in the array and does this for until there is an even number at the current position. This is one of the most optimal solutions with O(n) runtime and O(1) space complexity.
