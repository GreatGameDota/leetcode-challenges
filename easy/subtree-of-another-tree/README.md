Details: The problem is seeing if a binary tree appears inside of another binary tree. My algorithm traverses the main tree using an iterative bfs and whenever it finds a node with the same value as the sub tree's root it starts a recursive dfs to check if its the same as the subtree. This algorithm is probably not the quickest.
