Details: The problem is simply summing all binary numbers made with the paths to each leaf of a binary tree. My algorithm does a breadth first search and keeps a running value for each binary number for each leaf and adds the value to a total when the search hits a leaf. The runtime of this algorithm is the runtime of bfs/dfs.
