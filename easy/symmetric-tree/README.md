Details: The problem is simply comparing two binary trees and seeing if they symmetrical around the root. My solution uses recursive dfs to traverse both trees in opposite order at the same time and check if a difference occurs. This can easily be expanded to iterative bfs using the same logic of checking the opposite sides each time. This is the most optimal solution.
