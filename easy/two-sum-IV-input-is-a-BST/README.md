Details: The problem is just seeing if two nodes in a BST add up to a given value. My solution is a simple brute force where you keep track of the value of every node subtracted from the target and subtract the node's value by every other value being tracked. This solution has a very slow runtime and is far from the best algorithm. Solution 2 has the better algorithm with O(n) runtime.
