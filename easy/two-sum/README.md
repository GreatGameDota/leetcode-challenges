Details: The problem is simply finding the index of two numbers in a list that add up to the target. My algorithm sorts the list and keeps track of the original indexes, then goes through the list and adds pairs of numbers till it finds the target. This runs in O(nlogn) runtime but the fastest algorithms run in O(n).
