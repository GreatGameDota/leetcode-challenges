Details: The problem is simply finding if a string is a valid palindrome (ignoring all non numeric and alpha characters). My algorithm simply has two pointers at the beginning and end which skip over any invalid characters and check if the characters they are looking at are the same. This runs in O(n) runtime which is the most optimal.
