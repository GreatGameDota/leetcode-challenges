Details: The problem is simply checking a string of parenthesis and brackets if its a valid set of them. My algorithm uses a stack to store a character if its an opening bracket. If the bracket is a closing bracket then I check if the character on the top of the stack is the same type as the current character. This algorithm has a runtime of O(n) which is the best possible runtime.
