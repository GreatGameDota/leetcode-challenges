Details: The problem is creating an algorithm that will solve the N-Queens puzzle and return the amount of solutions based on the given board size. My algorithm uses a brute force backtracking algorithm that explores all possibly permutations and returns the amount of boards that completely solve the puzzle. This algorithm is far from the most optimal algorithm.
