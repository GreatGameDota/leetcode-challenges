Details: The problem is creating an algorithm that will solve the N-Queens puzzle. My algorithm uses a brute force backtracking algorithm that explores all possibly permutations and returns all boards with the desired amount of queens. This algorithm runs way slower than the most optimal algorithm and might exceed time limit in more submission attempts.
