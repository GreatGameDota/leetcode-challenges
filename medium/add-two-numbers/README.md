Details: The problem is simply adding two numbers which are both stored in separate linked lists but in backwards order. My algorithm first creates a new linked list with the sum of each digit of the two numbers and then loops backwards in the new list clearing any values greater than 9. This algorithm has a runtime of O(n) where n is the length of the largest number given.
