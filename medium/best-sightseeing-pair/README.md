Details: The problem is finding the best pair of numbers that have the highest value where the value is determined by the sum of the two numbers minus the distance between the two numbers. My algorithm iterates over all numbers and keeps track of the highest number pair. For each number it calculates the pair value with the highest value pair and saves the largest one while at the same time checks to make sure the highest number is still the highest. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
