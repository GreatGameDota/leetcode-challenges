Details: The problem is finding the maximum amount of profit from buying and selling a stock where you can buy and sell multiple times and buy/sell on the same day. My algorithm simply greedily takes any amount of profit by looping over the array and keeping track of the smallest price. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm. This question does not deserve to be a medium.
