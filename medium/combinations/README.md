Details: The problem is finding and returning all combinations of k numbers between the range 1 to n. My algorithm uses backtracking to explore all combinations of the numbers by adding all numbers greater than the last number added to the current combination and saving the current combination once its length is equal to k. This is the most optimal algorithm.
