Details: The problem is comparing version numbers and returning whether the two numbers are the same or one is bigger than the other. My algorithm uses two pointers to iterate over both version strings and determines the number between each period. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime where n is the length of the longer version string. This is the most optimal algorithm.
