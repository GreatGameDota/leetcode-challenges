Details: The problem is simply multiplying two complex numbers together and the given numbers and final output are strings. My solution just parses the two strings which gets all four numbers from the given input, computes the multiplication and then constructs the final string answer. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime where n is the combined lengths of the four numbers in the input strings.
