Details: The problem is simply finding the greatest area between two points in an array where the value is the height and the difference in the indices is the width. My algorithm starts at the beginning and the end and calculates the area then moves down the side with the smallest value. This algorithm has a runtime of O(n), which is the best possible runtime for this problem.
