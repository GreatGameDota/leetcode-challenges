Details: The problem is counting the amount a number appears in a given ordering of numbers which is determined by the inputted number of times this is repeated. My solution iteratively loops the amount of times the counting should happen and for each time gives a separate function the previous string outputted from this separate function (base case just being a string of 1). This separate function also iteratively goes down the given string and counts all the unique numbers in that string. Runtime for my algorithm is too complex to compute.
