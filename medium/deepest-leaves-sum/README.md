Details: The problem is simply finding the sum of all nodes that are leafs on the deepest level of a binary tree. My algorithm uses recursive dfs to explore the whole tree and keep a running sum of all nodes which are on the lowest level. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal.
