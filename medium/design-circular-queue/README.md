Details: The problem is implementing a circular queue without using built in queue data structure. My algorithm stores all numbers in a vector and adds new numbers to the back and pops the first number added by erasing the first number from the vector. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is not the most optimal algorithm (which runs in O(1) runtime using two pointers).
