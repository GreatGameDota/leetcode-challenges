Details: The problem is simply finding the one duplicate number in an array. My algorithm just does a simple pair search after sorting to find the duplicate. This has a runtime of O(nlogn) and a memory complexity of >O(1). This is not the most optimal solution which would have a runtime of O(n) and memory of O(1).
