Details: The problem is simply computing the Conway's Game of Life on a matrix. My first solution simply loops through the matrix creating a new matrix based on the surrounding tiles and my second solution creates the new matrix in-place with no extra memory. Both solutions have the most optimal runtime of O(n*m) and O(n\*m), O(1) space complexity respectively.
