Details: The problem is finding the most optimal way to rob houses to get the most profit where if you rob adjacent houses the cops are called. My algorithm uses dp to keep track of the best profit by either continuing only robbing even or odd houses or switching to an even or odd house. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
