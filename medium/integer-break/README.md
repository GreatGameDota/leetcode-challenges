Details: The problem is finding the greatest product of a set of numbers which add up to the given number. My solution simply calculates the amount of 3's in the final result then adds on the remaining value. This runs in O(1) runtime which is the most optimal runtime. I also came up with a O(n) dp solution which is typical for this problem.
