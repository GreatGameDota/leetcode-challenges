Details: The problem is determining whether two given smaller strings can be interwoven together to form a larger given string. My algorithm uses backtracking and memoization to explore all combinations of valid interweaves of the two strings to find if one completes the whole larger string. This is far from the most optimal algorithm which is using 2d dp.
