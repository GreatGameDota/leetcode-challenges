Details: The problem is creating the largest value number that is also a palindrome from a given list of numbers. My algorithm counts all the digits given and sorts the counts in ascending order before building the final string. It builds the final string by adding every pair of digits and keeping track of the largest lone number to add in the middle. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
