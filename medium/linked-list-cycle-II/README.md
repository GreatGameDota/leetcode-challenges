Details: The problem is finding the beginning of a cycle in a linked list. My algorithm is the best algorithm to do this problem that uses a fast and slow pointer. First it finds the cycle by incrementing fast and slow pointers until they meet then you move one pointer to the beginning and increment both by one until they meet again. Where they meet is the beginning of the cycle.
