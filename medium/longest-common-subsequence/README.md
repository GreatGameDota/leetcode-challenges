Details: The problem is finding the longest subsequence in two strings where all letters are the same and in the same order. My algorithm uses bottom-up dp to keep track of the longest subsequences of all combinations of the two words. This runs in O(n*m) runtime with O(n) space. This is the most optimal algorithm.
