Details: The problem is finding the longest sequence of consecutive numbers in a list. My algorithm first sorts the list then traverses it counting the sequences of consecutive numbers and saving the longest sequence. This runs in O(nlogn) runtime with O(1) extra space (if not counting sort algorithm) which is not the most optimal solution of O(n) runtime and O(n) space complexity.
