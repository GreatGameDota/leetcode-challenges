Details: The problem is finding the longest subarray with the maximum bitwise and. My algorithm simply finds the longest subarray with the largest number. It does this by iterating over the array and finding the largest number and keeping count of the amount of consecutive largest numbers. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
