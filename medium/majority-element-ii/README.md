Details: The problem is finding all elements that appear more than n/3 times in a list. My algorithm just uses an unordered map to count the occurrences of every number then I only return numbers that appear more than n/3 times. This isn't the most efficient algorithm as it has O(n) space complexity instead of O(1).
