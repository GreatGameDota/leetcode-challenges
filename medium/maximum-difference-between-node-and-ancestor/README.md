Details: The problem is simply finding the largest difference between two nodes in a binary search tree. The two nodes need to be ancestors to each other however. My algorithm is the simple brute force method which traverse the whole tree and at each node checks every node before it to find the largest difference. This algorithm is very slow with a runtime >O(n) while the most optimal has a runtime of O(n).
