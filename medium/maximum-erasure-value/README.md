Details: The problem is finding a subarray with all unique letters and with the largest sum and returning the sum. My algorithm uses a sliding window and hash table to test every subarray from left to right that has unique characters and keep track of the subarray with the largest sum. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(n) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
