Details: The problem is finding the highest sum from taking k elements from the beginning or end of a list. My algorithm uses a sliding window to slide over the array with a window of n - k size and find the window with the smallest sum. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
