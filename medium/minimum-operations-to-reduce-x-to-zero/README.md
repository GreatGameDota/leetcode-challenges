Details: The problem is determining the minimum amount of operations to make a given number zero where each operation is either picking the first or last element of an array, removing it, and subtracting the value from the number. My algorithm finds the longest subarray in the list where the sum of the subarray is equal to the total sum minus the given number. This guarantees that the remaining elements add up to the given number and are the minimum amount of steps needed to minimize the given number to zero. This is the most optimal algorithm.
