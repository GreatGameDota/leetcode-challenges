Details: The problem is multiplying the number values of two given strings and returning the result as a string. My algorithm manually multiplies the two strings by multiplying each digits in one string by all digits in the other then manually summing all of those multiplication results. This runs in ~O(n\*m) runtime with ~O(n\*m) space which is optimal but not the most optimal.
