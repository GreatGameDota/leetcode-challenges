Details: The problem is determining the amount of ways to get from start to end in exactly k steps where each step is moving 1 to the left or right. My algorithm uses top-down dp using recursive backtracking with memoization to explore all possible paths. This is optimal but not the most optimal (can use bottom-up dp and more efficient top-down dp).
