Details: The problem is determining the total combinations of subarrays of all zeros in a list. My algorithm iterates over the list and counts the size of each subarray of zeros in the array and based on the size, calculates the total combinations from the current subarray. This runs in O(n) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
