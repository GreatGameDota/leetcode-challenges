Details: The problem is simply sorting a linked list's even and odd indices so all odds appear in order first followed by the even indices. My algorithm simply iterates over the list stringing together the odd and even nodes individually then connecting them at the end. This runs in O(n) runtime and has a memory complexity of O(1) which is the most optimal solution.
