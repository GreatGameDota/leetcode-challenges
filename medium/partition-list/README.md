Details: The problem is simply partitioning a linked list where all numbers less than a target come first followed by all numbers greater than or equal to the target. My algorithm strings together two new lists where one holds the less than numbers and the other the greater than numbers. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime which is the most optimal runtime.
