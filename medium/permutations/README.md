Details: The problem is generating all permutations of numbers given a list of numbers. My algorithm uses backtracking to explore all permutations of all numbers by keeping track of which numbers were already visited and adding all numbers into each permutation list until the list uses all numbers. This algorithm has a massive runtime and space complexity however it is the most optimal algorithm.
