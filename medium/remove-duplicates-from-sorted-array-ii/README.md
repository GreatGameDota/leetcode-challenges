Details: The problem is simply removing duplicates from an array in place so a number can only appear at most two times. My solution uses two pointers to keep track of where to add a number to the list as it loops through the list. It then keeps track of the current number and if its been added two times or not. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime which is the most optimal.
