Details: The problem is simply removing duplicates from a linked list where any number that is duplicated is fully removed from the list. My algorithm just loops through the list checking the next value if its the same as the current and if it is removes all nodes with that value. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime which is the most optimal.
