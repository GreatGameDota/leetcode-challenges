Details: The problem is finding and returning 10 character sequences that repeat given a string. My algorithm loops through the string and for everything 10 letter sequences checks it in a hash map to see if it is already there. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime however isn't the most efficient as you can store each letter as an int.
