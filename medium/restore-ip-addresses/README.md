Details: The problem is finding all valid IP addresses given a string of digits. My solution uses recursive backtracking to explore all combinations of IP addresses that can be made by cutting off the first 1, 2, or 3 digits for each backtracking step and checking if the cutoff number is valid. This is the most optimal solution.
