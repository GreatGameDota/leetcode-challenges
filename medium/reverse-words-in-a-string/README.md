Details: The problem is reversing the order words appear in a string ignoring all worthless white space. My algorithm first stipes extra spaces around the string. Then it loops backwards getting one word at a time and adding it to the return string. This algorithm runs in O(n) runtime and O(n) extra space complexity which isn't the most efficient algorithm but has the most optimal runtime.
