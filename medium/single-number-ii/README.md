Details: The problem is finding the one lone number in a list where all other numbers appear 3 times. My algorithm is the brute force algorithm that is not optimal at all. I count the occurrences of all numbers in the list then loop through the counts and return the number that appears once. This is far from the most optimal solution using XOR and bit masking.
