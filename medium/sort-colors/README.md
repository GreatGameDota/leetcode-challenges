Details: The problem is sorting an array of numbers where there can only be 3 different numbers (0,1,or 2). My algorithm uses two passes where I store the frequency of each number type then I loop through the list placing all 0's then all 1's etc. This runs in O(2n) runtime with O(1) space which is not the most optimal (O(n)).
