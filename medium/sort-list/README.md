Details: The problem is simply sorting a linked list. My solution is the simply solution where I store the linked list into a vector, sort it, then convert it back into a linked list. This solution runs in O(nlogn) time which is the best runtime however runs in O(n) memory space. The most optimal solution has O(1) memory space however I knew to do that I would have needed to reimplement merge sort which I don't have the knowledge to do.
