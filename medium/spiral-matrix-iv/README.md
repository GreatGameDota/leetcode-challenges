Details: The problem is converting a linked list into a matrix however each number is added to the matrix in a spiral order. My algorithm iterates over every element in the linked list and adds it to the matrix while keeping track of the indices of where to add them. This runs in O(n*m) runtime with O(1) space which is the most optimal algorithm.
