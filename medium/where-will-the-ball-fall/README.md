Details: The problem is determining which indices at the top of a 2d matrix will end up if they fall to the bottom of the matrix. Where in this matrix, there are either left or right slopes. My algorithm manually simulates the balls rolling down the matrix by checking the previous slopes and whether a ball is on those slopes. This runs in O(n\*m) runtime with O(n\*m) which is optimal but not the most optimal (O(1) space).
